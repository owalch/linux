The program ampel.jar simulates a traffic light connected
to the lp1 parallel port of a PC.

The three colors are controled by the three lower bits of
the data port (on when set to '1'):

	b0 -> red 
	b1 -> yellow
	b2 -> green

	b7 is set to '1' to make it work (emulates real
	hardware).

There is a key, which controls bit b6 of the status port:
when key is pressed, b6 = '1' otherwise b6 = '0'.
